✨React Application for Trip Packing✨

This React application is designed to assist users in organizing their trip essentials efficiently. Let's break down the main components and their functionalities:

◇ App Component (App.js): The main component that orchestrates the entire application. Utilizes state management through the “useState” hook to keep track of the packing list items.
◇ Logo Component (Logo.js): A simple component that renders the application title.
◇ Form Component (Form.js): Enables users to input new items for their packing list. Includes a form with fields for item description, and quantity. Ensures that an item is only added when the description is not empty. Utilizes the “onAddItems” prop to pass the new item to the parent App component.
◇ PackingList Component (PackingList.js): Manages the display and actions related to the packing list. Allows users to sort the list based on input order, description, or packing status. Renders each packing item using the Item Component. Provides a dropdown for sorting and a button to clear the entire list.
◇ Item Component (Item.js): Represents an individual item in the packing list. Includes a checkbox for marking the item as packed, the item description with quantity, and a delete button. Toggles the packing status and deletes the item based on user actions.
◇ Stats Component (Stats.js): Displays statistics about the packing list. Shows a motivational message if the list is empty. Calculates and presents the total number of items, packed items, and the percentage of items packed.
